# Raum Network 
Raum Network is a Web3.0 based Object Storage Solution that intends to compete and provide better service with the existing storage solutions at both peer to peer and enterprise level. The Contract for the Project is completely stored in Blockchain making it auditable and transparent for the end Users.

Raum Network Opted for Polygon as its inaugural project to launch on the Platform. Polygon provides many facilities and Raum Network will be working on using Zero Knowledge Consensus for maintaining user credentials.


# Solution 
1. Object Storage Solution - Object Storage solution(S3) for large enterprise as well as Independent end user - Raum Network will be providing Object Storage Solutions better known as S3 Storage for both the Independent User or Large or Medium Scale Enterprises in terms of providing a significant better scalability, security and Cost Management Solution.

2. Different Tiers for Different Cases - Different Tiers for different use cases (Concurrent Addition, backup, Archival Storage) - Raum Network will be providing Different Tiers of Storage as per the needs of the Client. Currently we are working on providing Archival Storage, Concurrent Addition and backup Storage as per the end user require.

3. Ease of Integration - All the Services provided by Raum Network can easily be integrated with Web 2.0 as well as Web 3.0 providing Users with Control over their data, Better connectivity, Ubiquity and many other features bundled with Web 3.0

4 .Role Management and Control - Raum Network will be Providing Role Based Access Control (RBAC) where the Main Administrator Can Provide one or multiple Access Roles as per the Requirement as well as provide and manage Different Data Access Point for the Sub Users for Easy Access to The Shared Data.

5. Scalable Infrastructure - Raum Network will be Built Upon an Scalable Infrastructure model so that it will always have the required Data Nodes as the Users Availability as well as the Data Nodes will be Dynamic in Nature i.e. The Size of the Data Node can be Increased or Decreased as per the User Requirement.

6. Vast Storage - Raum Network Will be providing Data Storage on the Network Varying from 0 Bytes Up to 5 Tebibytes so that anyone can have their data stored without facing any storage issues.

7. Multiple Gateway Implementation - Raum Network will be implementing Connection through Multiple Gateway which in terms will be providing Better and Faster Connectivity throughout the Globe along with Less Chances of Eavesdropping on a Particular Gateway.


# Features 
1. Wallet Connect Access - Raum Network will provide the user to login in the system from any provided list of wallets. This feature will work as a Single Sign off system to facilitate a faster and secure login for the users. The combination of public key and private key will be used as a digital signature to allow user login.

2. Role Based Access - Raum Network will provide extreme functionality only for the enterprise level to assign the roles as per the hierarchy. There can be one or multiple managers who can provide or revoke access from the people.

3. Multiple Gateways for Storage Access - Raum Network will have multiple gateways. These will be divided into quorum (1 main node, 2 failover nodes) to access our storage so that even one node goes down next nearest available gateway node will always be available to access the storage without any downtime.

4. Storage Tiers - Raum Network will provide storage so that it suffices every end-user use case. It will be divided into three storage classes (Standard Class, Cold Class, Archival Class). Where the user can decide which type of data they want to store in the storage class category.


# Technical Aspects 
* Raum Network has a straight forward decentralized Infrastructure.
* Flow 1 shows the authentication of the user using some crypto wallet. Let’s say metamask.
* Flow 2 starts, once the user authenticates and log in the system. They can upload and download the data
* WAF working as a reverse proxy provides storage nodes from getting directly interacted with client end and providing security with incoming traffic.


# Consensus 
Proof of Authority - Raum Network uses POA Consensus to authenticate the User. Here identity-as-a-stake mechanism is used for verification. The Process is automated and does not require validators’ is suitable for both Private and Public Networks including POA Network, where trust is distributed.
